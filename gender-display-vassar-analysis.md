## The Original Question

The conversation began with this question:

> "Using a Michael Vassar type analysis, why do women show off their bodies regularly, but men generally don't show off their genitals with tight underwear?"

The initial response offered a standard evolutionary psychology framework with rationalist vocabulary. But the conversation quickly turned to deconstructing the question itself.

---

## The Standard Evolutionary Psychology Answer

The textbook evo-psych account runs as follows:

### Parental Investment Asymmetry

Women have obligatory high investment (pregnancy, lactation, years of dependency). Men have potentially minimal investment (single sex act). This creates different selection pressures: women evolved to be choosy about mate quality, men evolved to compete for access to women.

### What Each Sex Selects For

**Women selecting for men:** Resources, status, willingness to invest, good genes.

**Men selecting for women:** Fertility indicators (youth, health, hip-to-waist ratio, clear skin, symmetry).

The key claim is that female fertility is more visually assessable than male quality - you can estimate a woman's reproductive value from looking at her more easily than you can estimate a man's provision capacity or genetic quality.

### Therefore Display Strategies Diverge

Women benefit from displaying fertility cues (the things men are scanning for). Men benefit less from direct body display because what women want isn't primarily visible - it's resources, status, dominance, social proof. A man's body signals some genetic quality but his bank account, social position, and behavior signal more of what women are selecting for.

### Genital Display Specifically

Penis size has weak correlation with fertility or genetic quality. Unlike breasts (lactation capacity proxy) or hips (birth canal width proxy), male genitals don't signal much that women are selecting for. Meanwhile overt genital display reads as low-status desperation or threat - high-value males don't need to advertise, they demonstrate through dominance and resource accumulation.

---

## The Frame is Wrong: A Vassarian Deconstruction

A genuine Vassar-style analysis destabilizes the premise itself rather than answering the question as posed.

### The Asymmetry is Partly Artifactual

Women aren't displaying genitals either - they're displaying secondary sexual characteristics. The actual parallel would be: women display breasts/hips/skin, men display chest, arms, shoulders, status markers. Men *do* display, just different body regions. The question assumes an asymmetry that's partly an artifact of how we categorized things.

### Historical and Cross-Cultural Variance

The "universal" pattern is actually specific to post-Victorian Anglo bourgeois culture:
- Greek athletes competed nude
- Renaissance codpieces were explicitly genital-emphasizing fashion
- Regency-era men wore extremely tight pants
- Contemporary K-pop aesthetics involve substantial male body display
- Gay male subculture has entirely different norms

### Who Enforces These Norms, and For Whose Benefit?

This is the Vassarian move.

**Female display norms** are policed heavily by other women - slut-shaming as intra-sexual competition for mates who provide resources.

**Male display norms** are policed by other men - the guy in tight pants gets called gay, which is really about maintaining what might be called "male coalition legibility." Men need to be readable to other men for alliance purposes. A man visibly optimizing for female attention signals: "his priorities are elsewhere," "he's competing with us rather than cooperating."

The interesting question isn't "why don't men display" but **"what coordination equilibrium does the norm serve and who defects?"**

### Revealed Preferences Tell a Different Story

Look at what happens when you remove cross-sex selection pressure: gay male aesthetics trend toward substantial body display (muscles, tight clothing). Lesbian fashion trends away from conventional female display.

But this framing may itself be flawed. Research suggests biological sex shapes preferences more than orientation does - and gay men diverge from straight men more than lesbian women diverge from straight women. So the aesthetic differences might reflect:
- What men selecting for men produces (male-male selection pressure)
- Gay male subculture developing its own norms outside straight male coalition policing
- Some combination

## The "Beings vs Doings" Frame

A simplified version of the evo-psych model suggests: **Women are human BEINGS and men are human DOINGS.**

Women's mate value is supposedly more intrinsic - assessed by what you *are* (young, fertile, healthy, symmetric). Men's mate value is more extrinsic - assessed by what you've *accomplished* (status, resources, demonstrated competence).

### What's True in This

There does seem to be an asymmetry in how mate value is assessed. Male status hierarchies are more fluid and achievement-based. A man can climb or fall dramatically based on what he does. Female mate value correlates more heavily with age-linked traits that aren't really "earned." This creates genuinely different phenomenologies - different anxieties, different strategies, different relationships to time.

### What's Suspicious

The frame naturalizes some pretty contingent arrangements:

**It overstates the distinction.** Women's "being" still requires enormous maintenance work - makeup, clothing, fitness, social reputation management. It's not passive. And men's "being" matters plenty - height, face, voice, frame all affect outcomes independent of achievement.

**Cross-cultural variance.** In economies where women produce substantial resources (foraging societies, modern dual-income), the pattern shifts. Women's economic contribution changes what they select for. The "pure" evo-psych story assumes a male-provisioning context that isn't universal.

**Who benefits from this narrative?** The framing can justify male disposability ("you're only worth what you produce") while simultaneously justifying female objectification ("you're only worth your body"). Both sexes get a raw deal described as "natural."

---

## What Would Vassar Actually Say?

Based on his intellectual style - deep skepticism of both mainstream narratives and contrarian ones - a Vassarian analysis might proceed as follows:

### "You're All Still Inside the Frame"

Both the evo-psych narrative and the progressive critique are performing legibility for their respective tribes. The evo-psych guys are doing "based truth-teller who accepts uncomfortable biological realities" - it's a status move within a certain intellectual subculture. The progressive critique is doing "sophisticated enough to see through naturalization" - also a status move. Neither is actually trying to build a working model.

### "What Do People Who Win Actually Do?"

Vassar tends to ask: who has accurate models, revealed by their outcomes? The guys who are actually successful with women often have intuitive models that match neither the evo-psych textbook nor the feminist critique. Same for women who successfully secure high-value partners. The public narratives are post-hoc legitimation, not operating instructions.

**But wait** - this is itself another frame. What does "winning" even mean here? High partner count? Relationship stability? Reproductive success? Subjective satisfaction? These don't correlate well. The guy who's "successful with women" by PUA metrics might be optimizing for something that doesn't actually make him happy.

### "The Interesting Question is About the Current Selection Environment"

Ancestral conditions matter less than what's actually being selected for *now*. Modern environments have contraception, paternity tests, female economic independence, social media, dating apps. These change the game completely. Talking about "evolved preferences" while ignoring that the selection pressures have radically shifted is like analyzing chess strategy when everyone's now playing poker.

### "Who Benefits from the Confusion?"

Vassar would note that fuzzy thinking about sexual dynamics serves certain interests. If people had clear accurate models, they'd make better decisions. Various parties - from media to institutions to individual manipulators - benefit from keeping the discourse confused.

### The Meta-Move

He'd probably say the "beings vs doings" frame is useful not because it's biologically true but because it captures something about the current negotiated equilibrium - which could shift.

## Research Deep Dive: What the Studies Actually Show

### The Buss 37-Culture Study (1989)

David Buss surveyed approximately 10,000 participants across 37 cultures.

**Core findings:**
- Women valued "good financial prospects" more than men in 36/37 cultures
- Men preferred younger mates; women preferred older mates
- Men valued physical attractiveness more; women valued ambition/industriousness more

Subsequent work confirmed: "sex differences in preferences for good financial prospects were nearly universal (97%), and sex differences in preferences for ambition/industriousness were prevalent (78%)... replicated with multiple methods across dozens of cultures."

### The Eagly & Wood Challenge (1999)

Alice Eagly and Wendy Wood reanalyzed Buss's data and found that **in countries with more egalitarian gender relations, the male-female differences were smaller.**

Their interpretation: the sex differences reflect social roles and economic constraints, not evolved psychology. The social structural theory states that because men and women tend to have different social roles, they become psychologically different to adjust to their social roles.

### The Stated vs Actual Preference Problem

Research by Eastwick et al. found a critical gap:

> "Participants exhibited traditional sex differences when stating the importance of physical attractiveness and earning prospects in an ideal partner. However... no sex differences in the associations between participants' romantic interest in real-life potential partners and the attractiveness and earning prospects of those partners."

In speed-dating studies, "ideal preferences assessed before the event failed to predict what inspired their actual desire at the event."

### What Actually Predicts Long-Term Success?

The largest meta-analysis of relationship predictors (pooling 43 longitudinal datasets with 11,196 couples) found that the strongest predictors of romantic relationship success tend to be relationship-specific predictors such as a person's perception of their relationship - rather than personality characteristics, socioeconomic status, gender, or age.

For long-term satisfaction: Couples who manage a ratio of five positive responses to one negative response are more likely to have a healthy, long-lasting partnership.

### Dating Apps and New Dynamics

Research shows both men and women pursue partners who are on average about 25% more desirable than themselves on dating apps, creating pronounced hierarchies. This creates "repeated exposure to implicit rejection and unmet expectations" causing "emotional fatigue and cyclical patterns of disengagement."

---

## The Gender Equality Paradox

The prediction from social role theory: as countries become more gender-egalitarian, sex differences in preferences and behavior should shrink.

**The actual finding:** The gender-equality paradox is the disputed finding that various gender differences in personality and occupational choice are **larger** in more gender equal countries.

### The Evidence

There was a strong correlation (r = .69) between a country's sex differences in personality and their Gender Equality Index. Women typically score higher than men on all five personality trait factors (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness), and these relative differences are *larger* in more gender equal countries.

In Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Norway:
- Women comprise over 80% of nurses and primary school teachers
- Men dominate engineering and technical trades
- Female representation in engineering faculties remains below 30% despite expansive welfare systems and anti-discrimination policies

A 2024 study analyzing 2.5 million adolescents across 85 countries confirmed: "The finding that sex differences in academic strength in reading and science are larger in gender-equal Scandinavian countries than in more traditional Middle Eastern countries challenges the popular belief that sex differences are mainly driven by socialisation pressure."

### Proposed Explanations

**The resource hypothesis:** One can fully express their liking or disliking once basic needs are met, after which sex-specific tastes can grow. In countries with higher living conditions, these tastes can be fully expressed.

Less gender-equal countries are also often poorer, and females within them may be more motivated by economic pressure to pursue STEM careers.

### The Critique

Researchers at the University of Helsinki state that gender equality in a given country does not generally correlate with differences between men and women. They note: "When considered in more detail, it's very difficult to show support for the 'gender-equality paradox' as a clear phenomenon."

A June 2025 analysis found that these gender differences correlated more strongly with **Western cultural clustering and measurement reliability** than with gender equality metrics.

### What This Means

This complicates both positions:
- If social role theory is right, removing constraints should reduce differences. But it doesn't.
- If evo-psych is right, preferences should be stable regardless of context. But they're *more* pronounced in certain contexts.

Neither model cleanly wins.

## Negotiated Equilibria: The Beach Example

Consider a crowded beach with diverse groups: locals, nationals from other states, people from other continents and religions (covered Muslims, spring breakers), the handicapped, high and low IQ individuals, etc.

### How Norms Emerge

Norms emerge through:
- What people do and get away with
- What provocations others absorb rather than escalate
- What deviations reveal dysfunction vs get ignored

The "negotiation" isn't explicit - it's the continuous process of testing, adjusting, absorbing. When someone's swimwear or behavior pushes a boundary, the response (or non-response) of others either reinforces the norm or shifts it slightly.

### Individual Trauma-Absorption

Individual trauma-absorption is real - the person who doesn't make a scene about something that bothered them is doing work that maintains the surface equilibrium. If it isn't absorbed, it risks revealing the beach's social dysfunction.

### Power Asymmetries

In contexts with power asymmetry, the "baseline" itself is contested.

**In a Muslim country:** Revealing beachwear isn't just a low-stakes provocation - it can be read as disrespect for the entire normative order. The absorption cost isn't just individual discomfort; it's potential erosion of cultural/religious authority.

**In a post-colonial context:** A European tourist in tight swimwear at a beach in Senegal or the Philippines carries different weight than a local doing the same thing. The tourist's body display can read as: "I get to be comfortable here; your norms don't apply to me." Local absorption of this isn't neutral tolerance; it's a continuation of a pattern where indigenous norms yield to foreign ones.

### The Vassarian Question

Who sets the baseline? Whose comfort gets protected? Whose discomfort gets treated as "their problem to absorb"? These aren't neutral - they reflect power configurations.

---

## Adversarial Epistemology: When Standard Science Fails

### Non-Adversarial Domains

Standard Bayesian/frequentist empiricism works well in domains where:

**Physics:** Electrons don't care what you believe about them. Your hypothesis doesn't change their behavior. Data accumulates reliably.

**Chemistry:** Molecules don't have interests. Experiments replicate because the subject isn't strategizing against you.

**Engineering:** Bridges either hold weight or they don't. The bridge isn't trying to deceive you about its load capacity.

**Most biology:** Cells aren't lying. (Though even here: immune systems, parasites, and cancer cells are somewhat adversarial.)

### What Makes a Domain Adversarial

1. **Agents with interests** - Subjects benefit from you having wrong beliefs
2. **Reflexivity** - Your beliefs affect the system, which affects the data, which affects your beliefs
3. **Stakes** - People care about the conclusions, so they contaminate the evidence
4. **Preference falsification** - People report what's socially safe, not what they actually think/want

### Adversarial Domains

**Mate preference research:** Everyone has stakes. People report socially acceptable preferences, not actual ones. The evo-psych answer and the feminist answer both serve tribal interests. Subjects lie (to researchers and themselves).

**Economics/finance:** Markets are adversarial. If you discover a pattern, acting on it changes the pattern. Other agents are strategizing against you. Historical data doesn't predict future behavior because agents adapt.

**Politics:** Information is weaponized. Data is selectively gathered and presented. "Studies show..." is often tribal signaling. Replication crisis is worst in politically charged subfields.

**Sociology of contested topics (race, gender, IQ):** The conclusions have policy implications. Researchers face career incentives. Funding depends on expected results. Peer review is ideologically captured.

**History (especially recent):** Winners write it. Archives are curated. What gets preserved vs destroyed isn't random.

**Self-knowledge:** You have interests in believing certain things about yourself. Your introspection is unreliable because believing X about yourself might be adaptive even if X is false.

### How to Identify Adversarial Domains

1. Do agents in the system benefit from your ignorance?
2. Does your knowing change their behavior?
3. Are there strong social/political/economic stakes in the conclusions?
4. Is there heavy preference falsification in self-reports?
5. Do "findings" conveniently align with tribal positions?
6. Is there selection pressure on which researchers enter/succeed in the field?

### Where Can We Definitely NOT Find Adversarial Dynamics?

Honestly, almost nowhere human. Even "pure" science has:
- Career incentives (publish or perish)
- Funding politics
- Reputational stakes
- Tribal dynamics (paradigm defense)

The closest might be:
- Amateur astronomy (no career stakes, objects don't lie)
- Pure mathematics (proofs either work or don't)
- Some citizen science (no institutional capture)

But Vassar's point is darker: "most people are like zombies when it comes to their ability to think and act independently." The adversarial dynamics have already won in most domains. What looks like neutral inquiry is usually captured.

## "The Question is Already Infowar"

### Deconstructing the Original Prompt

The original question was: "Why do women show off their bodies regularly, but men generally don't show off their genitals with tight underwear?"

Before answering, ask - **why does this question feel like a natural question?** Something put it in your head as something worth asking. The framing contains assumptions:

1. *"Women show off bodies regularly"* - Is this universal, or historically/culturally specific? Victorian women didn't. Many cultures have different norms. The "regularity" is contingent.

2. *"Men don't"* - Greek athletes, Renaissance codpieces, Regency tight pants, K-pop aesthetics, gay male culture. The "general" pattern is less general than it feels.

3. *The asymmetry is the puzzle* - Why assume there should be symmetry? The question presupposes that we need to explain a deviation from expected parity.

### Where Did This Framing Come From?

Possibly: Contemporary discourse where "women's bodies are objectified" and "men aren't sexualized the same way" are common talking points. The question accepts this frame and asks for explanation.

But notice: **accepting the frame already concedes certain things.** It accepts that current arrangements are stable enough to require evolutionary/deep explanation rather than being contingent and shifting.

### "Waking Up"

"Waking up" in Vassar's sense means noticing:
- Which questions feel obvious to ask
- Which frames feel natural
- Which assumptions are invisible
- Whose interests are served by you thinking in this frame

The question "why do women display and men don't" might serve:
- Naturalizing current arrangements (this is just how it is)
- Evo-psych tribal positioning (biology explains it)
- Feminist tribal positioning (it's patriarchy)
- Keeping you inside a frame where you're analyzing display rather than asking who profits from display industries

### A Genuinely "Awake" Question

A genuinely "awake" question might be: "What conditions would have to change for this pattern to shift? What would I predict if I were right about the mechanism?"

The deepest Vassar move might be: **stop trying to explain the pattern and start asking who profits from you thinking about it this way.**

---

## Elie Ayache and the Limits of Quantification

### Core Thesis

Elie Ayache, a former options market-maker turned philosopher of finance, argues:

> "Not only does the market not need probability, the market replaces probability... immeasurable randomness implies a qualitative rather than quantitative property: prices will go up or down, but we cannot say by how much."

Future financial market prices are fundamentally uncertain in the Knightian sense - "we cannot make reliable quantitative probabilistic statements about future price changes over any horizon, and this is true irrespective of how much historical data we have at our disposal."

### The Connection to Mate Preferences

The evo-psych move and the probabilistic move share a structure:

1. **Observe patterns** (mate preferences, price movements)
2. **Quantify them** (cross-cultural correlations, volatility estimates)
3. **Build models** (evolved mechanisms, stochastic processes)
4. **Make predictions** (these preferences are stable, this option is worth X)

Ayache says this fails for markets because:
- The future is genuinely contingent, not probabilistically determined
- The model affects the reality (traders use models, which changes prices)
- You can't stand outside the system to measure it objectively

### Applied to Mate Preferences

The evo-psych model similarly fails because:
- The future is contingent (social arrangements can shift radically)
- The model affects reality (believing "women want X" changes how people behave)
- You can't stand outside the system (researchers have stakes, subjects lie)

### Contingency as Primary

Ayache proposes that we need to think about markets not through probability but through *contingency as primary* - the fact that things could be otherwise is more fundamental than any statistical regularity.

**Applied here:** Instead of "what's the probability distribution over female mate preferences?" we might ask "what would have to change for preferences to be radically different?" The contingency - the could-be-otherwise - is more real than the pattern.

### The Alternative Epistemology

The scientists who want to quantify behavior assume:
1. There's a stable pattern
2. It can be measured
3. Measurements enable prediction

In adversarial/reflexive domains, there may be no stable pattern. The measurement changes the system. The prediction is self-defeating or self-fulfilling. You need a different epistemology.

That epistemology might look like: understanding domains as ongoing negotiations rather than fixed systems. The question isn't "what is the probability that women prefer X" but **"what equilibrium is currently in place, who maintains it, and what would destabilize it?"**

---

## The Evolutionary Mismatch Hypothesis

### The Basic Structure

**Ancestral environment (E1):** Some condition existed (food scarcity)

**Evolved mechanism:** A psychological/physiological trait evolved as adaptive response (craving calorie-dense foods)

**Modern environment (E2):** Conditions changed (food abundance, processed hyperpalatable foods)

**Mismatch:** The same mechanism now produces maladaptive output (obesity, diabetes)

The mechanism "worked" in E1 but "misfires" in E2 because the inputs changed while the mechanism stayed the same.

### Examples

| Ancestral Environment | Evolved Mechanism | Modern Environment | Mismatch Outcome |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Food scarcity | Crave calorie-dense foods | Food abundance | Obesity |
| Small tribes | Status-seeking drives | Globalized economy | Billionaire hoarding |
| ~150 person social groups | Social comparison | Social media | Anxiety/depression |
| Rare strangers | Fear of out-group | Diverse cities | Prejudice |

### Application to Display Norms

The evo-psych claim might be: in ancestral environments, male status was physically visible - strength, health, resources you could display. Physical display and status display were the same thing. In modern environments, status is more abstract (credentials, network, institutional position) and physical display can actually undermine perceived status.

So there's a mismatch: our evolved assessment systems still respond to physical cues, but our cultural status systems have decoupled from them. The "friction" is between what our brains are wired to notice and what actually predicts success in the current environment.

### Limitations

This is speculative reconstruction. The mismatch hypothesis has been applied to diet, sleep, exercise, social network size, and some mate retention behaviors - but not specifically documented for body display norms. The framework is real; specific applications may be just-so stories.

---

## Canalized vs Fluid Sexuality

### Definitions

**Canalized** means channeled into a fixed path - like water flowing through a canal. Once set, it doesn't easily change. The claim is that male sexuality (both gay and straight) tends to be more fixed: once oriented toward a particular type of target, it stays there.

**Fluid** means more responsive to context, relationship, and situation. The claim is that female sexuality is less locked into specific targets - women's attractions are more influenced by emotional connection, social context, and can shift more across the lifespan.

### The Research Finding

Lesbian women's mate preferences look a lot like straight women's mate preferences (both follow "female" patterns). But gay men's preferences diverge more from straight men's preferences.

This supports the idea that:
- Women have a sexuality that's responsive to relational context regardless of orientation
- Men have a sexuality that's more fixed in its patterns, but gay and straight men end up in different fixed patterns

### Caveats

This is controversial. Critics would say it risks essentializing gender differences and might reflect cultural conditioning rather than biology. The "female fluidity" finding has been used to support claims that lesbian identity is "less real" or more chosen, which is politically fraught.

---

## Honest Summary

### What We Know

- Cross-cultural sex differences in stated mate preferences are real and robustly replicated
- These stated preferences don't predict actual behavior well in face-to-face contexts
- The gender equality paradox is real but contested - sex differences may be larger in egalitarian societies
- The mismatch hypothesis is a real framework but hasn't been applied specifically to body display norms
- Gay/lesbian research suggests biological sex shapes preferences more than orientation does, but gay men diverge from straight men more than lesbian women diverge from straight women

### What We Don't Know

- Whether stated preferences reflect "real" preferences that are socially overridden, or whether they're just social performance
- Whether the gender equality paradox reflects "natural" preferences being expressed or measurement artifacts
- What the causal mechanisms are for any observed patterns
- How to separate evolved dispositions from social learning in adversarial research domains

### The Vassarian Conclusion

We're in a period of rapid environmental change where old equilibria are destabilizing, new ones haven't formed, and everyone's models (including rationalist ones) are probably substantially wrong in ways that won't be clear until later.

The public discourse serves coordination functions, not truth-tracking. The honest position is: there's some evolved asymmetry, but it's heavily modulated by economic and cultural context, and we're bad at separating the signal from the noise.

## Final Reflection

The original question - about gendered body display - opened into something much larger: a meditation on the limits of empirical research in adversarial domains, the difference between explaining patterns and understanding who benefits from them, and the deeper question of whether quantitative modeling can capture phenomena that are genuinely contingent.

The Vassarian move is not to provide a better answer but to ask: **why are you asking this question, who benefits from the available answers, and what would you do differently if you had a truly accurate model?**

Perhaps the honest conclusion is not "here's what's really going on with gender display" but rather "here are the frames in play, here are their tribal affiliations, here's what the data actually shows, here are its limitations, and here's why you should be suspicious of anyone - including me - who claims to have the real answer."
