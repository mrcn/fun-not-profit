# The Covert Dismantling of Reason
## A Conversation About Pragmatism, Education, and the Death of Independent Thought

---

## Introduction

This document traces a conversation exploring how independent reasoning was systematically removed from Western society, with particular focus on the role of Pragmatist philosophers (especially John Dewey) in creating a simulacrum of reason while destroying its substance.

The core insight: **Modernity** (actual Enlightenment reason) was replaced by **Modernism** (the aesthetic of reason), and this replacement was done *in the name of reason itself*.

---

## The Central Distinction: Modernity vs. Modernism

**Modernity** = The actual Enlightenment project
- People can reason independently
- Truth is discovered through comparison and evaluation
- Common law assumes juries can evaluate arguments
- Education teaches logic, rhetoric, dialectic
- "Level 4 literacy" - ability to compare competing arguments

**Modernism** = The simulacrum/aesthetic
- The *appearance* of rationality
- Credentials and expertise replacing judgment
- Bureaucratic processes
- "Scientific" management
- Institutional validation
- "Level 3 literacy" - can perceive arguments but not compare them

As one commentator noted: "Modernism isn't about reason at all! That's modernity! -Ism implies a simulacrum. A vibe. A tradition of 'looks like reason' specifically to replace a process of reason that was being actively dismantled, most overtly by the Italian Futurists and Fascists, more covertly by Pragmatists and Progressives."

---

## The Two Forms of Dismantling

### Overt Dismantling: The Futurists

**Who:** Italian Futurist movement (1909-1944), led by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti
**Approach:** Explicit rejection of reason and the past
**Claims:**
- "Burn the museums and libraries!"
- Celebration of technology, speed, violence, war
- Glorification of action over contemplation
- Explicit anti-rationalism
- Later aligned with Fascism

**Result:** Obviously anti-Enlightenment, easy to identify and resist

### Covert Dismantling: The Pragmatists

**Who:** American Pragmatist philosophers - Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.
**Approach:** Redefine reason while claiming to champion it
**Claims:**
- "We're not abandoning rationality, we're *improving* it!"
- Making education more democratic and practical
- Updating philosophy for the modern world
- Being scientific and evidence-based

**Result:** Arrives wearing reason's clothes, much harder to resist

---

## The Pragmatist Redefinition of Truth

### Classical Epistemology
**Truth = Correspondence with reality**
- Something is true if it accurately describes what is
- Truth-seeking means comparing claims to reality
- Independent of social consensus

### Pragmatist Epistemology
**Truth = What works, what's useful, what produces good outcomes**

**Surface appeal:** "Of course we care whether ideas work!"

**The trap:** Who decides what "works"? What counts as a "good outcome"?

**Result:** Truth becomes institutional consensus about utility, not correspondence with reality.

---

## The Education Mechanism: Two Types of "Learning By Doing"

This is where the confusion arises - Dewey uses language that sounds like authentic learning through experience, but implements something entirely different.

### Type 1: Real Learning By Doing (What Actually Worked Historically)

**Examples:**
- Pirates learning navigation through actual voyages
- Frontiersmen solving survival problems
- Merchants learning through market consequences
- Apprentices learning trades one-on-one
- Colonists establishing new communities

**Key Features:**
- **Real stakes** - you fail, you die/go broke/starve
- **Real problems** - not pedagogical exercises
- **Actual judgment required** - no institutional answer key
- **Direct consequences** - immediate feedback from reality
- **Self-directed** - pursuing your own goals
- **Minimal institutional mediation**

**Outcome:** Develops independent reasoning out of necessity

### Type 2: Dewey's "Learning By Doing" (Progressive Education)

**Setting:**
- Still in institutional schools
- Controlled environment
- Teacher-managed activities
- Artificial/pedagogical problems

**Key Features:**
- **No real stakes** - it's still school, not reality
- **Simulated problems** - designed by educators
- **Institutional validation** - success = meeting school expectations
- **Indirect consequences** - grades, not market/survival feedback
- **Institutionally directed** - pursuing school's goals
- **Heavy institutional mediation**

**Outcome:** Trains deference to institutional authority while appearing progressive

## The Literacy Levels Framework

From the Vassar transcript, around 1:24:00-1:32:00:

### Level 4 Literacy (Enlightenment Standard)
**Ability:** "To look at a text and compare arguments within the text for and against a thing"

**Required for:**
- Independent reasoning
- Evaluating competing claims
- Participating in common law proceedings
- Making principled decisions
- Comparing evidence and counter-evidence

**Historical prevalence:** Common among 18th-19th century English working class, frontier Americans, merchants, etc.

### Level 3 Literacy (Modern Standard)
**Ability:** "Allows you to perceive an argument, perceive that it's an argument for a thing, but not put parts together"

**Can do:**
- Understand that someone is making an argument
- Follow the general point being made
- Perceive positions and claims

**Cannot do:**
- Evaluate whether it's a *good* argument
- Compare it to competing arguments
- Synthesize or reconcile different positions
- Make independent judgments

**Result:** Can consume arguments, cannot evaluate them independently. Must defer to experts.

---

## The Historical Development: How We Got Here

### Phase 1: Enlightenment Success (1600s-1800s England)

From the Vassar transcript (around 28:00-45:00):

**The English Pattern:**
- Each 50 years from the Bubonic Plague onward
- Number of free, affluent people roughly doubles
- Their per capita wealth roughly doubles
- From <1% in 1350 to ~16% by 1650
- By then, they control the government

**Key features:**
- Common law system assumes people can evaluate arguments
- Markets reward independent thinking
- Free and speedy trials cheaply available
- People read complex texts (Dickens) in groups
- Minimal formal schooling (1-2 years typical)
- High "level 4 literacy" despite minimal schooling
- Learning happened through real experience

### Phase 2: German Counter-Reaction (1800s Prussia)

**The Problem (from aristocratic perspective):**
- Rising bourgeoisie threatens aristocratic power
- Can't just suppress education (need literate workers)
- Can't allow full enlightenment education (creates competitors)

**The Solution: Prussian School System**

From Vassar (around 1:37:00-1:41:00):

**Designed to:**
- Train obedience while appearing to educate
- Create "meritocratic specialness" through credentials
- Produce workers who can follow instructions
- Prevent students from becoming competing employers
- Keep people in their place while thinking they have rights

**Method:**
- Extended, comprehensive schooling
- Focus on rote learning and obedience
- Credential-based advancement
- Train "level 3 literacy" not "level 4"
- Create specialists who know their domain but defer otherwise

**Target:** Train German peasants to "play the part on TV of a person who thinks they have rights while actually obeying their aristocratic leads and not standing up for themselves"

### Phase 3: American Import via Dewey (1890s-1950s)

**Key claim from Vassar (1:32:00):**

> "in America it wasn't implemented until much later and it was done by John Dewey as pragmatism and it was somewhat more perverse than the system that I'm describing [the Prussian system]"

**Why "more perverse":**
- Prussian system was relatively honest about social control
- Dewey's system claims to be democratizing and liberating
- Uses progressive language ("learning by doing," "democratic education")
- Imports Prussian structure while sounding American
- Harder to resist because it sounds like freedom

**The mechanism:**

Vassar (1:32:00): "the official stated mission depended on who they were talking to and there was no internet whereby people correlated what mission was said to different people. when people are telling the industrialists that we'll keep your students ignorant and dependent and telling the students we'll educate you and train you, you should regard the official state admission as being the more cynical one."

**Different audiences, different stories:**
- To industrialists: "We'll create obedient workers"
- To workers: "We'll educate your children"
- To progressives: "We're democratizing education"
- To students: "You're learning practical skills"

**But following the footnotes:**

Vassar claims that Dewey's surface writings sound democratic, but "if you follow the footnotes he does though" - his sources include people who explicitly argue for social control through education.

---

## The Legal Parallel: From Common Law to Discretionary Power

The same transformation happened in the legal system, providing a parallel track of evidence.

### Common Law System (Traditional)

**Core principles:**
- Law is discovered, not decided
- Precedent guides interpretation
- Assumes people can evaluate arguments
- Juries can compare evidence
- Justice based on symmetrical principles
- Fair and speedy trials cheaply available

**From Vassar:** In the 1800s, common people regularly participated in legal proceedings, made and defended arguments, expected fair hearings.

### The Pragmatist Transformation: Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

**Holmes as Supreme Court Justice (early 1900s):**

Vassar calls him one of "this loathsome group of people, the Pragmatists."

**Holmes's "Bad Man Theory of Justice":**
"Whatever you may think the law really is what a bad man thinks a judge will decide to do."

**Analysis:** This is pragmatism applied to law - truth about law isn't what the law *says*, it's what judges will *do*. Truth = what works in practice = what power decides.

**Holmes's precedents:**
- "Three generations of idiots is enough" (justifying eugenics/sterilization)
- "Shouting fire in a theater" (used to imprison WWI protesters)
- Fundamentally redefined justice from principle to prediction

### Modern Legal System (Post-1938)

From Vassar (around 1:00:00-1:10:00):

**Characteristics:**
- Discretionary rather than principled
- Judges have wide latitude
- Procedures designed to muddy waters
- Success correlates with lawyer connections, not merit
- Expensive, slow, inaccessible
- "Legal realism" = normalizing what was previously called corruption

**Key point:** The system maintains the *appearance* of common law (Constitution, precedent, courts) while operating on entirely different principles (discretion, connections, institutional power).

**Result:** Another simulacrum - looks like justice, functions as power.

---

## The Two-Track System

This is where it gets genuinely sophisticated. The system doesn't just dumb everyone down - it creates two tracks that reinforce each other.

### Track 1: The General Population

**Education receives:**
- Extended schooling (12+ years eventually)
- "Learning by doing" in controlled settings
- Socialization and group work
- Practical skills training
- Level 3 literacy

**Result:**
- Can understand that experts are making arguments
- Cannot independently evaluate competing expert claims
- Trained to defer to credentials and institutional authority
- Believe they're educated and rational
- Actually lack capacity for independent reasoning

### Track 2: The Expert Class

**Education receives:**
- Same basic system plus additional credentials
- Specialized training in narrow domains
- PhD programs focused on institutional navigation
- Success = mastering what the field accepts
- Publishing what gets approved
- Citing the right people

**Result:**
- Real knowledge within their specialty
- Same lack of general reasoning ability
- Expertise = institutional validation, not truth-tracking
- Trained to defer to other credentialed experts outside their domain
- Also believe they're rational
- Actually engaged in "procedural conformity wearing a lab coat"

### The Reinforcing Loop

**For the population:**
- "I can't evaluate these complex issues"
- "I should trust the experts"
- "The experts have credentials and studies"
- "Being rational means deferring to expertise"

**For the experts:**
- "My expertise is in X, I defer to experts in Y"
- "The institutional consensus is..."
- "The peer-reviewed literature says..."
- "We need more funding/studies to be sure"

**Result:** Everyone *thinks* they're being rational (deferring to evidence, following the science, trusting experts) but no one's actually doing the epistemic work of comparing competing arguments independently.

**The beautiful trap:** The forms of reason (peer review, credentials, studies, expert consensus, institutional processes) persist and even multiply, while the substance (actual ability to evaluate competing arguments) is removed.

---

## The Rationalist Community: The Modern Attempt

### The Promise (1990s-2010s)

From Vassar's discussion (around 2:14:00-2:31:00):

**Origins:**
- Grew out of communities that still assumed Enlightenment values
- Programmers, mathematicians, etc. - specialists in enlightenment reasoning
- "Reactionary" in the sense of reacting against post-modern erosion
- Explicitly tried to revive truth-seeking practices

**Goals:**
- Teach people how to think clearly
- Overcome cognitive biases
- Evaluate evidence properly
- Make better decisions
- Eventually: prevent AI catastrophe, improve the world

**Early success:**
- Created communities focused on truth-seeking
- Developed shared vocabulary for reasoning
- "The Sequences" - systematic training in avoiding reasoning errors
- Built organizations (MIRI, CFAR, etc.)
- Influenced effective altruism movement

### The Sellout (2010s-2020s)

**Vassar's central claim:** "The rationalists have consciously, explicitly broken from the enlightenment principles"

**Evidence cited:**
- Scott Alexander's posts discussing whether to "sell out"
- "The Cause is Not the Community" (acknowledging the tension)
- "Why Do I Suck" (acknowledging the blog got worse after selling out)
- Formation of community around social belonging rather than truth
- Increasing deference to institutional consensus
- Refusal to make accusations even with overwhelming evidence

**The pattern:**

Around 2:24:00-2:31:00, Vassar describes different layers:

1. **Scott Alexander (Slate Star Codex):** "Third degree simulacrum" - maintains some truth-seeking but within acceptable bounds, won't make accusations
2. **Zvi Mowshowitz:** "Second degree simulacrum" - spreads truth over many pages so no third party needs to synthesize, maintains discretion through volume
3. **Jessica Taylor:** "First degree simulacrum" - more abstract, avoids making accusations by staying theoretical
4. **Oliver Habryka, Ben Pace:** Occasionally make accusations but "sheepishly" and with attitude of "no one should do anything about it"

**What they can't do while remaining in good standing:**

> "You have to be so absurdly boring to point out that people have given up on trying to not destroy the world without it being an accusation."

**The core failure:** Maintained the aesthetic (truth-seeking language, reasoning about AI, cost-benefit analysis) while abandoning the substance (won't make accusations, won't challenge institutional consensus, won't defend principles that cost them grants).

**Why this matters:** They recreated the exact same pattern - forms of reason without substance. They proved that even people explicitly trying to resist this pattern fell into it.

---

## The Fundamental Taboo: Making Accusations

This is perhaps the deepest insight from the conversation.

### In a Justice-Based System

**Core mechanism:**
- People can make accusations
- Accusations are evaluated through principled processes
- Evidence for and against is compared
- Conclusions are reached through comparison
- Society recognizes validity of defending yourself or others

**Result:** Truth-seeking is possible because fault-finding is legitimate

### In a Modernist System

**Core mechanism:**
- Making accusations singles you out for persecution
- Defending yourself singles you out more
- Only certain types of people (credentialed experts) can make certain claims
- Even experts must frame as "studies suggest" not "X did Y"
- Actual fault-finding is replaced with scapegoating or silence

**From Vassar (around 2:26:00-2:30:00):**

> "You might say that the concept of conspiracy theory is the idea that trying to spill the beans and reveal things that the powerful don't want revealed makes you a loser not a hero."

**The mechanism:**

If you can make accusations:
- You can identify problems
- You can compare evidence
- You can reach conclusions about fault
- You can demand accountability

If you cannot make accusations:
- You can only describe abstract patterns
- You must avoid naming responsible parties
- You must defer to institutional processes
- You become complicit through silence

**The rationalist failure:** They accepted that you shouldn't make accusations even when:
- Evidence is overwhelming
- It would require only a "trial-like process of bringing together evidence and counter evidence"
- The facts are already in the mainstream scholarly consensus
- Making the accusation is necessary to prevent harm

**Result:** "The rationalists are fundamentally on the side of schools and against courts" - they maintain the aesthetic of reason but abandon the practice of fault-finding that makes reason actionable.

---

## Conspiracy Theory vs. Historical Explanation

A crucial digression that clarifies the whole framework.

### The False Category

From Vassar (around 2:07:00-2:17:00):

**The claim:** "Conspiracy theory" is not a coherent category.

**What gets labeled "conspiracy theory":**
- QAnon
- The Protocols of the Elders of Zion
- JFK assassination alternative theories
- UFO coverups
- COVID lab leak
- Election fraud claims

**What do these have in common?** Not their truth value, not their evidence level, not their logical structure.

**What they actually have in common:** They're "low status theories" - theories that threaten power or suggest the powerful are hiding things.

### The Distinction That Matters

**You CAN'T have certainty about:** What was concealed (because it was successfully concealed)

**You CAN have certainty about:** That concealment occurred (because concealment leaves evidence)

**Example: JFK Assassination**

Vassar: "We know with certainty that there is an illegal conspiracy to conceal information about Kennedy's murder. We do not know what the information is. That's because we know it was concealed, but we know with certainty that it was concealed."

**The conflation:** The term "conspiracy theory" conflates:
1. Justified certainty about concealment (which is what law/courts would care about)
2. Unjustified speculation about what was concealed (which may or may not be valid)

By calling both "conspiracy theory," the label dismisses legitimate fault-finding (obstruction of justice) along with speculative theories.

### Whistleblowing vs. Conspiracy Theory

**Same underlying reality:** People in power are hiding things

**Different status:**
- **Whistleblower** (high status): Has documentary evidence, smoking gun, can prove the concealed thing
- **Conspiracy theorist** (low status): Has evidence of concealment but not of the concealed thing itself

**The problem:** For many important issues, you will never get the smoking gun documentary evidence precisely because powerful actors are competent at concealment.

**Result:** If you demand smoking-gun proof before acknowledging fault, you make power immune to accountability.

**From our earlier conversation:**

> "There's some amount of things that are happening that do not have smoking guns and yet they are operating in the background. And in the absence of that direct evidence, if you demand that the only model of the world that is accurate is one with direct evidence, you will always fall short of a complete picture of reality because there are some things for which you cannot have proof."

### Conspiracy Invitation vs. Conspiracy Theory

**QAnon as example:**

Vassar: "QAnon is a set of rumors about the people in charge now are absolutely bad and encouragement to join a amorphous low commitment mob that is going to vaguely troublemate and rally revival and hope to become a powerful enough mob to at some point suddenly shift and get rid of those guys"

**Not a theory:** It's a call to tribal mobilization

**The mechanism:** Create vague claims about enemies → build mob → claim power through numbers

This is different from historical explanation (analyzing actual evidence of actual events) and different from justified inference about concealment.

---

## The Courage Question

Near the end of the conversation (around 2:54:00-3:00:00), this becomes explicit.

### What Kind of Courage?

**Not honor culture courage:** Defending yourself through violence, establishing dominance

**Justice culture courage:**
- Making accusations
- Listening to accusations
- Defending principles that cost you
- Allocating attention authentically
- Not letting persecution distort your thinking

**From Vassar:**

> "You need to be able to both deal with frivolous accusations... and make non-frivolous accusations and attend to the non-frivolous accusations of others in a non-frivolous manner."

### The Scarcity of Courage

**Vassar's claim:** Not one person in a thousand has the courage required

> "not one person in a thousand has the level of courage to be considered remotely decent or like not totally shady and low integrity... by a normal person of a century ago, no matter how well resourced they are."

**Why?** The taboos on breaking with institutional consensus are stronger than we realize.

**The prostitution analogy:**

> "If someone wasn't a [sex worker] during the Third Reich, they would probably not have helped Holocaust victims. But if someone was not a [sex worker] during the Third Reich, they would definitely not have helped Holocaust victims because the taboo on sex work was much much much much weaker than the taboo on helping Holocaust victims."

**Point:** Even weak taboos are rarely broken. The taboos on challenging institutional power are much stronger than we think.

### What Authentic Allocation of Attention Means

**From Vassar:**

> "I have the courage to allocate my attention and have emotions in an authentic way as if I was an authentically idealistic and therefore libertarian not progressive 9-year-old."

**Someone who:**
- Feels the golden rule is "a little bit offensive" because obviously you should do more (Plato's "tell the truth and pay your debts")
- Allocates attention to things that will cause you to be singled out
- Doesn't let targeting condition your attention
- Doesn't get confused, overconfident, lash out when persecuted
- Can be persecuted without understanding why and without it distorting your thinking
- Can think independently while being persecuted for years

**The key:**

> "the persecution is not so bad. You just have to not have that targeting condition your attention to not do so and not get confused, get overconfident, lash out"

### The Standard

**You need to:**
1. Face persecution for truth-telling
2. Not let it distort your reasoning
3. Not make up defensive stories
4. Not try to defend yourself pointlessly
5. Continue thinking clearly while being attacked
6. Eventually arrive at conclusions that match "mainstream scholarly consensus interpreted in a manner that leaves very little interpretation to imagination"

**You're not going to articulate it first and best** - the mainstream scholars already got there, but in language that maintains plausible deniability.

---

## What Actually Works: The Alternative Path

Throughout the conversation, there are hints at what actually develops independent reasoning.

### Historical Examples

**From the transcript:**

1. **English working class (1800s):**
   - Minimal formal schooling (often none)
   - High literacy from reading in groups
   - Regular participation in legal proceedings
   - Cheap access to fair trials
   - Level 4 literacy despite minimal "education"

2. **American frontier:**
   - One-room schoolhouses (1-2 years typical)
   - Learning through actual doing (farming, trading, building)
   - Real consequences (crop fails = starvation)
   - Community courts requiring argument and evaluation
   - No experts to defer to
   - Must coordinate without central authority

3. **Merchants, pirates, colonists:**
   - Learning through market/survival consequences
   - Direct feedback from reality
   - Real stakes (bankruptcy, death, success)
   - Necessity breeds competence

### The Pattern

**What they all have in common:**

1. **Real environment** - not institutional/controlled
2. **Real consequences** - from reality, not grades
3. **Necessity** - must think or fail
4. **Minimal institutional mediation**
5. **Subject-object relations** - dealing with reality, not navigating bureaucracy
6. **Symmetrical social relations** - common law, not hierarchy

### Modern Possibilities?

**From Vassar's comments about what rationalists could have done:**

Around 2:48:00-2:54:00, discussing if rationalists had succeeded:

They would have:
- Been "part of Deep Mind"
- Had "enormous resources and privileges"
- Been "very FOMO shady"
- Not published things publicly
- Educated "spark kids etc from a younger age and more totally and more for separation from the larger society"
- "Look more like an intelligence agency"
- Developed AI "in a way that allowed them to produce products that could be sold in the larger world but not reveal the advantages"

**The principle:** Create actual space outside institutional control where:
- Real problems must be solved
- Real consequences enforce reasoning
- Can't defer to broader institutional consensus
- Must develop actual competence

### The Aspiration vs. Humility Question

**Question raised:** "Can you aspire to power and be humble at the same time?"

**Vassar's answer:** "Absolutely. The [successful people] are fanatically humble."

**The reasoning:**

Anyone honestly pursuing radical life extension (or any ambitious goal) will:
1. Start with idealistic aspiration
2. Encounter reality's constraints
3. Discover coordination is harder than assumed
4. Find institutional medicine can't actually deliver
5. Conclude: need to build new institutions
6. Realize: this requires understanding how power actually works
7. Become humble about what's possible

**The convergence:** "of course you want radical life extension. That is the Schelling point that anyone acting authentically is going to be pursuing."

**Then backchaining from that goal:**
- Need better medical research
- Need better hospitals
- Need at least one place where everything is monitored, optimized
- This requires resources, coordination, institutional building
- Can't do it by "fundraising for life extension"
- Must do it through "fundraising that gets you to the hospital and then doing the life extension research within the general budget"

**Historical examples cited:** Charité hospital in Berlin, Rockefeller University - "good faith efforts to do the convergent thing that reason tells you that you should do"

---

## The Current State: "Dead in the Water"

### Where We Are Now

**From our conversation:**

> "there's a vacuum because the constitutional frame of power where there is a lever that you can pull has broken down... the only thing that's really available to manipulate is vibes and if somebody's actually capable of organizing those vibes into something that resembles constitutional power again then you regain mastery over the direction of the ship, but the best laid project of the last century completely failed at actually achieving it. And so now we're dead in the water."

**Vassar's response:** "Yeah."

### What Remains

**Not entirely hopeless:**

1. **Other language groups:** "There are probably other projects that have epistemic and direction that we aren't well queued into in other language groups, just not in English."

2. **AI tools:** "You can have a conversation with Anthropic's Claude a year before you could have a conversation with Gemini or GPT and talk about the vibes of power and how they were used"

3. **Small pockets:** "Something the size of like I don't know the 30 righteous men of Talmudic tradition or the 50 people that keep God from destroying Sodom and Gomorrah... it looks more like that 10 to 50 range, biblical scarcity"

### The Great Reset Example

**Vassar's analysis of "the Great Reset":**

Around 44:00-48:00 and later references:

**What it is:** "A branding term for whatever economic disasters happen because we have no idea what we're doing and have no control over anything"

**Not a plan:** "These are professional managerial class idiots who completely lack the level five required to read a paragraph of Bleak House... way way way too low to plan a great reset of the world economy but it is more than high enough to plan a marketing campaign"

**The function:** "Marketing for whatever economic disasters happen... You shouldn't be inspired by the fact that you're going to be in economic crisis to think that we don't have control over everything and therefore maybe you should fend for yourself and overthrow us"

**Key insight:** It's a cope, not a plan. The aesthetic of control ("we meant to do that") without the substance (actual planning or coordination ability).

### The Difficulty

**Why it's so hard to reconstitute:**

1. **Breadth of brainwashing:** Multiple generations now lack level 4 literacy
2. **Institutional capture:** All major institutions operate on modernist principles
3. **Taboo strength:** Stronger than we realize, harder to break than historical taboos
4. **Coordination problems:** Can't easily gather people outside institutional frame
5. **Resource requirements:** Building parallel institutions requires enormous resources
6. **Time pressure:** Various catastrophic risks approaching

**From Vassar:** "We've all been brainwashed into not believing that [reconstituting justice or honor systems] is real and we are in fact stuck in an inadequate equilibrium where we can't just reconstitute some sort of a system of justice or honor without some really clever hacking."

---

## Key Takeaways and Loose Ends

### Resolved Questions

1. **What happened to reasoning ability?** Systematically removed through education system, both traditional and progressive versions

2. **How did this happen covertly?** Done in the name of reason itself - "improving" education, "updating" philosophy, being more "practical" and "scientific"

3. **Why can't experts save us?** They're products of the same system - credentialed but not trained in independent reasoning

4. **Why did rationalists fail?** Recreated the pattern - maintained aesthetic while abandoning substance, wouldn't make accusations that cost them institutionally

5. **What's the difference between historical learning and school?** Real consequences vs. institutional validation, necessity vs. conformity

### Unresolved Tensions

1. **Individual agency:** How much can one person do? How much courage is actually required?

2. **Parallel institutions:** Is it possible to build outside institutional control with modern resource requirements?

3. **Timeline:** Can this be addressed before various catastrophic risks materialize?

4. **Communication:** How do you spread these insights when the system is designed to prevent exactly this kind of reasoning?

5. **Verification:** How do we know this analysis itself isn't another cope or simulacrum?

### Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Dewey's footnotes:** What specific sources reveal the cynical motivation?

2. **International variations:** What's happening in non-English-speaking countries?

3. **Successful resistance:** Are there examples of communities that successfully resisted this pattern?

4. **Reconstruction:** What would it actually take to build a parallel institution with real epistemic standards?

5. **AI implications:** Could AI tools enable end-runs around institutional gatekeeping? Or will they be captured too?

### The Core Pattern to Watch For

Whenever you see:

1. **Progressive-sounding language** about improving X
2. **Maintenance of X's forms** (institutions, processes, credentials)
3. **Removal of X's substance** (actual function, real standards)
4. **Increased deference to expertise** in X
5. **Decreased ability to evaluate** claims about X
6. **Taboos on questioning** the experts in X

You're likely seeing modernism replace modernity - the simulacrum replacing the real.

### The Ultimate Question

**From our conversation:**

Can we reconstitute actual reasoning capacity, actual justice systems, actual truth-seeking institutions?

**Or are we stuck with:**
- The forms without the substance
- The aesthetic without the practice
- The language without the meaning
- Vibes without levers

**Vassar's position:** It would require "really clever hacking" to escape the inadequate equilibrium we're in.

**The challenge:** Even the people who tried to do this (rationalists) fell into the same pattern.

**The hope:** Small pockets still exist. Other language groups might have success. AI tools might enable new approaches.

**The reality:** We're mostly "dead in the water."

## Appendix: The Frontier Schools Question

**Question:** Did frontier schools have any relation to Dewey's vision?

**Answer:** No - they were actually the opposite.

### Frontier Schools (1780s-1880s)

**Characteristics:**
- One-room schoolhouses
- Brief attendance (1-2 years typical)
- Basic literacy and arithmetic only
- Community-based and local
- Most learning happened OUTSIDE school
- Minimal institutional control

**Outcomes:**
- People achieved level 4 literacy
- Could participate in legal proceedings
- Could evaluate competing arguments
- Could coordinate without central authority
- Could read complex texts (Dickens, political philosophy)

### Dewey's System (1890s-1950s)

**Characteristics:**
- Extended comprehensive schooling
- Eventually 12+ years
- Centralized and expert-controlled
- Prussian-derived structure
- "Learning by doing" within institutional frame
- Heavy institutional control

**Outcomes:**
- Level 3 literacy (cannot compare arguments)
- Defer to credentialed experts
- Cannot evaluate competing claims independently
- Require institutional coordination
- Decline in ability to read complex texts

### The Irony

Dewey may have **claimed** to be democratizing education in the American spirit, but was actually **importing** the German aristocratic model designed to prevent independent thinking.

The frontier tradition represented authentic "learning by doing" with real stakes. Dewey created a simulacrum of it within institutional walls.

**Timeline:**
- Frontier schools **preceded** Dewey
- Dewey's system **replaced** the frontier approach
- No continuity between them, despite rhetoric

## Key Thinkers and Further Reading

The response to this analysis touches on a nuanced critique of how "reason" has been framed in modern discourse. This section expands on the core argument and suggests pathways for deeper investigation based on the sources and themes explored above.

### The Core Argument Revisited: Modernism as a "Simulacrum" of Reason

The analysis distinguishes between **modernity** (the historical period defined by rationalism, science, and progress) and **modernism** (a cultural/philosophical movement that repurposes the *language* of reason for non-rational ends). Key points:

1. **Modernism ≠ Reason**:
   Modernism is framed as a "tradition of 'looks like reason'" – a performative, aestheticized version of rationality used to dismantle *actual* critical thinking. This mirrors critiques from the **Frankfurt School** (e.g., Horkheimer/Adorno's *Dialectic of Enlightenment*), which argued that Enlightenment rationality was co-opted by capitalism and fascism to serve power, not truth.

2. **Historical Examples**:
   - **Italian Futurism/Fascism**: Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto glorified war, speed, and irrationality while using modernist aesthetics to mask anti-reason agendas. Mussolini's regime weaponized technology and propaganda under the banner of "modernization."
   - **Pragmatism**: Critics like Russell (in *The Revolt Against Reason*) saw Pragmatism as reducing reason to "what works," stripping it of universalist or moral dimensions.
   - **Progressivism**: The term here likely refers to movements that use rational-sounding frameworks (e.g., "efficiency," "optimization") to advance ideological goals, often sidelining ethical questions (e.g., technocratic governance).

3. **Why This Matters**:
   By framing modernism as a *simulacrum*, this analysis suggests that what we call "rationality" today is often a hollowed-out version of its Enlightenment roots – a tool for control rather than liberation. This aligns with **Andrew Feenberg's** critique of "social rationality" (markets, bureaucracies, technologies) which systematizes bias under the guise of neutrality (see his *Instrumentalization Theory*).

### Essential Reading: Diving Deeper

Based on the themes explored in this document, here are key works and thinkers to investigate:

#### 1. **Bertrand Russell's *The Revolt Against Reason* (1935)**

**Why?** Directly tackles how irrationalism (e.g., Fascism, racial theories) weaponizes "reason" while rejecting its universalist core. Russell argues that modern power structures exploit anti-reason rhetoric to dismantle democratic discourse.

**Key Quote**:
> "The cult of unreason… represents private passions, making strife inevitable."

**Relevance**: Russell's analysis predates Dewey's full implementation but identifies the pattern of using rational-sounding language to advance irrational ends.

#### 2. **Andrew Feenberg on "Formal Bias" and Instrumentalization Theory**

**Why?** His *Instrumentalization Theory* (2006) explains how "rational" systems (e.g., capitalism, bureaucracy) encode social hierarchies into technical designs. For example:
- A "rational" refrigerator size reflects family norms, not just physics.
- Climate tech may prioritize corporate interests over ecological justice.

**Pragmatist Link**: Feenberg's work bridges Pragmatism (e.g., Dewey's focus on lived experience) with Frankfurt School critique, showing how "rational" systems often fail to serve human needs.

**Key Insight**: Technical rationality is never neutral - it always embeds social choices. The question is whether those choices are made democratically or imposed by power.

#### 3. **Jason Ralph: "American Pragmatism, the Frankfurt School, and the Future of Critical International Relations Theory"**

**Why?** His article argues that Pragmatism (e.g., Dewey) offers a middle path:
- **Negative critique**: Exposing power structures (like modernist "reason").
- **Positive problem-solving**: Using technical knowledge democratically (e.g., climate governance).

**Key Insight**: Ralph warns against dismissing Habermasian discourse ethics, which balances critique with inclusive deliberation – a counter to both modernist dogma and populist irrationalism.

**Relevance**: Suggests a possible reconstruction path that acknowledges Pragmatism's critiques while rejecting its institutional capture.

#### 4. **Robin Hanson: "Rationality: Quit, All-in, or Bust"**

**Why?** Hanson outlines three paths for civilization's relationship with rationality:
1. **Bust**: Collapse due to cultural maladaptation.
2. **Quit**: Return to tradition/ignorance.
3. **All-in**: Use reason to consciously evolve adaptive cultures.

**Modernist Angle**: Hanson's "all-in" path aligns with Feenberg's call to democratize technical systems – turning modernism's tools toward emancipation, not control.

**Question Raised**: Can we go "all-in" on rationality when we've lost the capacity for Level 4 literacy? Or must we first rebuild that capacity?

### Secondary Sources and Connections

#### **The Frankfurt School: Dialectic of Enlightenment**
- Horkheimer and Adorno's analysis of how Enlightenment rationality became instrumental reason
- Parallels the modernity → modernism transformation discussed in this document
- Shows how "reason" can become its own opposite when severed from emancipatory goals

#### **Michel Foucault: Disciplinary Power**
- Analysis of how modern institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons) create "docile bodies"
- Parallels Vassar's critique of the education system's true function
- Shows how "rational" systems of classification and organization serve power

#### **Ivan Illich: *Deschooling Society* (1971)**
- Critique of institutionalized education similar to Vassar's
- Argues schools create dependency on institutions
- Proposes "learning webs" as alternative to compulsory schooling

#### **James C. Scott: *Seeing Like a State* (1998)**
- Analysis of how "rational" schemes for improvement (e.g., scientific forestry, urban planning) fail
- Shows pattern of "high modernism" imposing simplified models on complex reality
- Connects to Vassar's critique of modernist institutions

### Where to Start?

**For historical context**:
- Russell's *The Revolt Against Reason* (1935) to understand how Fascism distorted "reason"
- Illich's *Deschooling Society* (1971) for a contemporaneous critique of the education system

**For theoretical framework**:
- Feenberg's *Instrumentalization Theory* (2006) to decode how "rational" systems embed bias
- Scott's *Seeing Like a State* (1998) to see the pattern across multiple domains

**For reconstruction paths**:
- Ralph's article (2025) to see how Pragmatism might bridge critique and reform
- Hanson's "Rationality: Quit, All-in, or Bust" for civilizational-scale options

### The Central Question This Reading Addresses

This framework reveals modernism as a contested space: its rhetoric of reason can either mask domination (as in Fascism and technocratic governance) or, if reclaimed democratically, become a tool for liberation.

The choice, as Hanson frames it, is between:
- **Collapse** (rationality's complete failure)
- **Regression** (abandoning rationality for tradition)
- **Radical reconstruction** (going "all-in" on democratized rationality)

But as this document argues, we may not currently have the **capacity** to choose the third option - that capacity itself may need to be rebuilt first.

### Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Can Pragmatism be salvaged?** Ralph argues yes; Vassar implies no. What distinguishes democratic pragmatism from institutional capture?

2. **What is Feenberg's relationship to Dewey?** Does his "critical instrumentalization" successfully rescue pragmatist insights while avoiding Dewey's pitfalls?

3. **Are there successful counter-examples?** Have any educational systems avoided the modernist trap? Other language groups? Other cultural traditions?

4. **What role can AI play?** Can large language models help restore Level 4 literacy by making comparative argument analysis more accessible? Or will they be captured by the same institutional forces?

5. **Is the Frankfurt School's pessimism warranted?** Or are there paths to reconstruction they didn't foresee?

### The Pattern to Watch Across All These Thinkers

Across Russell, the Frankfurt School, Feenberg, Scott, and others, a common pattern emerges:

1. **Enlightenment rationality** = originally emancipatory
2. **Instrumental rationality** = rationality in service of power
3. **The masquerade** = instrumental rationality dressed in Enlightenment language
4. **The capture** = institutions that claim to embody reason but serve other ends
5. **The question** = can we recover emancipatory rationality, or are we trapped?

This document's contribution: Identifying how this capture happened through the education system, with Dewey as the key American figure implementing what the Prussians designed.

The reading above provides the broader intellectual context for understanding this is not an isolated phenomenon, but part of a larger transformation in how Western societies relate to reason itself.

## Conceptual Framework: Understanding the Critique

This section provides deeper analytical clarity on the distinction between modernity and modernism, and offers tools for evaluating the claims made throughout this document.

### The Core Distinction: Modernity vs. Modernism

The analysis throughout this document gestures at a distinction that shows up frequently in 20th-century intellectual history:

- **Modernity** = the *historical condition* of modernization: industrialization, capitalism, bureaucracy, science, mass politics, urbanization, secularization, "rationalization" (in Weber's sense).
- **Modernism** = a set of *cultural and artistic-political styles* that react to modernity—sometimes by extending it, sometimes by parodying it, sometimes by trying to aestheticize it.

The central argument can be summarized as:

> "What people call 'modernism' often functions less like a commitment to reason and more like an aesthetic that *looks like* reason—clean lines, efficiency-talk, 'scientific' rhetoric, managerial confidence—used to legitimize decisions that aren't actually being made via open inquiry."

### "Ism Implies Simulacrum": Style vs. Method

When we say **"Ism implies a simulacrum. A vibe,"** we're contrasting:

**Reason as a method:**
- Public criteria
- Falsifiability
- Revisability
- Error-correction
- Adversarial testing
- Transparent chains of argument
- Epistemic humility

**Reason as a costume:**
- Rhetorical markers of seriousness
- Charts and technical jargon
- "Evidence-based" slogans
- Sleek design
- Appeals to "progress"
- Managerial aesthetics

Many 20th-century critics worry that modern societies can drift toward **procedural theater**: institutions keep the *appearance* of rationality while the actual incentives drive motivated reasoning, factional capture, propaganda, or bureaucratic self-preservation.

This isn't a fringe idea; it's adjacent to mainstream themes:

- **Weber**: Rationalization and bureaucracy can become an "iron cage"
- **Frankfurt School**: "Instrumental reason" (reason as mere tool for control) crowds out reason as emancipation/understanding
- **Habermas**: "System" (money/power) colonizes the "lifeworld" (shared meaning), degrading genuine discourse

**The warning**: *Don't confuse "modern-looking" with "rational."*

### Why Italian Futurists and Fascists Matter

The reference to **Italian Futurism** (Marinetti, et al.) is polemical but not random. Futurism celebrated speed, machines, rupture with tradition, and often glorified violence; parts of the movement intertwined with early Italian Fascism.

If you're building the thesis "modernism is an aesthetic that can replace genuine reason," Futurism is a vivid exhibit: it can *look like* "the future" while being hostile to deliberation, pluralism, and truth-seeking.

**Important caveats:**
- Futurism/modernism isn't one thing; there are many modernisms
- "Modernist aesthetics" can support both liberatory and authoritarian politics depending on context
- Fascism often mixes modern techniques (mass media, industrial capacity) with myth, cult, and anti-intellectualism—making it a case study for "modern means, anti-rational ends"

**What to watch for**: How an aesthetic of "efficiency" and "dynamism" can become a substitute for justification.

### The Pragmatist Question: Charitable vs. Uncharitable Readings

The claim that Pragmatists and Progressives "covertly" dismantled reason is the most controversial element. It can be understood in at least two ways:

#### A) Charitable Interpretation

Some pragmatists (in some readings) shift emphasis from **Truth as correspondence** to **truth as what survives inquiry / works in practice**. Critics worry this can be heard as "truth is whatever we decide works," which *can* be used to justify managerial or political expediency.

Early 20th-century "Progressive Era" reforms often increased **administrative governance** (experts, agencies). A critic can say: "Technocracy *looks* like rationality but can reduce politics to management and crowd out genuine contestation."

#### B) Uncharitable Reading (Common Among Critics)

"Pragmatism = relativism = propaganda permission slip."

This is often overstated. Peirce and (many readings of) Dewey are intensely pro-inquiry; they're not arguing for vibes over truth. But the *rhetorical vulnerability* is real: "what works" can become "what benefits my coalition."

**To evaluate this fairly**, separate:
- **Pragmatism as philosophy**: Fallibilism, inquiry, experimental method
- **"Pragmatic" rhetoric in politics**: "Don't be ideological; be practical" (used to smuggle in power plays)

The document's argument is that even if Dewey's *philosophy* was pro-inquiry, his *institutional implementations* created systems that trained deference rather than reasoning.

### How This Connects to Rationality's Future

The "tri-lemma" about rationality's future—decline / retreat to tradition / go all-in on rational cultural adaptation—faces a crucial risk:

**The "go all-in" path can fail if "rationality" gets replaced by a modernist simulacrum**—the *branding* of rationality rather than its practice.

In that failure mode, you get:
- Performative expertise
- Ideological capture under "science" signage
- Optimization for metrics that stop tracking reality (Goodhart's Law)
- Moral certainty paired with thin epistemics
- Institutional power wearing reason's costume

**The meta-threat**: It's not only irrationality we must guard against; it's **counterfeit rationality**.

### Evaluating the Claim: What Would Real Reason Look Like?

To keep this analysis from drifting into "everything is propaganda," we need concrete criteria. What would count as evidence that a culture/institution is *actually* doing reason, not merely performing it?

**Concrete indicators might include:**
- Real tolerance for internal dissent
- Explicit error-correction mechanisms
- Prediction/forecast track records
- Transparency about uncertainty
- Willingness to revise sacred narratives
- Adversarial review that can actually block action
- Accountability when predictions fail
- Genuine debate rather than coordinated messaging

This turns the critique from a hot take into a **research program**: we can investigate specific institutions and ask whether they exhibit these features.

### A Framework for Honest Evaluation

To engage with these ideas without falling into conspiracy thinking or unfalsifiable critique, maintain these questions:

1. **What would count as disconfirming evidence?**
   - If we found educational systems that combined extended schooling with high Level 4 literacy?
   - If technocratic governance demonstrably improved truth-tracking?
   - If experts reliably outperformed lay judgment?

2. **Are there degrees of the problem?**
   - Some institutions more captured than others?
   - Some domains where expertise works better?
   - Some historical periods where the pattern was weaker?

3. **What are the alternatives' failure modes?**
   - Pre-modern education had low literacy, high superstition
   - Frontier education had high casualties, limited scope
   - Pure markets have their own pathologies
   - Direct democracy faces knowledge problems

4. **Can we test claims empirically?**
   - Compare reasoning ability across different educational systems
   - Track institutional forecasting accuracy
   - Measure tolerance for dissent
   - Assess error-correction speed

5. **Is reconstruction possible?**
   - Can we build institutions with better truth-tracking?
   - What would democratic expertise look like?
   - How do we escape inadequate equilibria?

This framework turns the analysis from a pessimistic diagnosis into an active research program.

## Conclusion

This has been an exploration of how independent reasoning was systematically removed from Western society, with particular focus on how this was done **in the name of reason itself**.

The pattern:
1. **Modernity** (actual Enlightenment reasoning) worked
2. **Modernism** (aesthetic of reasoning) replaced it
3. Done **covertly** through progressive/pragmatist movements
4. **Forms persist** (schools, credentials, experts, studies)
5. **Substance removed** (ability to compare competing arguments)
6. **Everyone thinks they're being rational** (deferring to experts, following science)
7. **No one can actually reason independently** (lack level 4 literacy)

The result: We're "dead in the water" with respect to constitutional power, left only with the manipulation of vibes.

The challenge: Even explicit attempts to revive reasoning (rationalist community) fell into the same pattern.

The question: Is there a way out? Or are we stuck in an inadequate equilibrium that requires "really clever hacking" to escape?
