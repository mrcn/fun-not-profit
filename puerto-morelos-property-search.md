## Important Notes

### What's Realistic for Your Budget
- **Under $50,000:** Primarily land only (build required)
- **$50,000-$100,000:** Some land with services, possibly older structures
- **$100,000-$200,000:** Condos/small houses (may be renovated)

### Beware of:
- Many properties under $200,000 are land only
- Beachfront properties typically start at $200,000+
- New construction/renovated units dominate the $150,000+ range
- Building costs in Mexico can add $50-100k+ to land purchases

### Best Strategy for "Poor Dude" Budget
1. **Option A:** Buy cheap land ($27k-$75k) + build slowly as funds allow
2. **Option B:** Look for older unrenovated condos (harder to find, check with local agents)
3. **Option C:** Consider nearby towns with lower prices, commute to Puerto Morelos
