# Próspera: The Narco Charter City

## Próspera: The Bullet Points

### What it is

- A private "charter city" on Roatán island, Honduras, run by a Delaware-incorporated company
- Operates outside Honduran law — own courts, own regulations, own tax system (1% business tax, 5% income tax, Bitcoin as legal tender)
- Residents can pick regulations from a menu of 36 countries or propose their own
- The company (Honduras Próspera Inc.) has veto power over the governing council

### Who's behind it

- Founded by Venezuelan-American wealth manager Erick Brimen
- Backed by Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, Sam Altman, Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase Ventures
- Funded through Pronomos Capital (~$150 million raised)

## Why "Narco Project"

This is the key part. The legal framework that made Próspera possible was created by people now convicted of drug trafficking:

**2009:** US-backed military coup ousts left-wing president Manuel Zelaya

**2012:** Honduran Supreme Court rules charter cities unconstitutional

**2012:** Congress (led by Juan Orlando Hernández) fires the four justices who ruled against it

**2013:** New ZEDE law passes, amending the constitution to allow private cities

**2014-2022:** Juan Orlando Hernández serves as president, champions ZEDEs

**2017:** Próspera founded under this framework

**2022:** Hernández extradited to the US

**2024:** Hernández convicted of trafficking **400+ tons of cocaine** into the US, using the Honduran military and police to protect drug shipments. Sentenced to 45 years.

**December 2025:** Trump pardons Hernández (notably, Thiel and Andreessen are close Trump allies)

**The direct connection:** The man who fired the judges blocking charter cities, then championed the ZEDE law as Congress president, then protected ZEDEs as president of Honduras — was simultaneously running a cocaine trafficking operation moving hundreds of tons of drugs through Honduras using state resources. President Castro called Próspera a creation of a "narco-regime" because the entire legal architecture enabling it was built by a convicted drug kingpin.

## The $11 Billion Shakedown

**2022:** Castro government repeals ZEDE law, Supreme Court declares it unconstitutional

**2022:** Próspera sues Honduras for $10.775 billion

That's **two-thirds of Honduras's annual budget** or **one-third of GDP**

Honduras withdrew from ICSID (World Bank arbitration) but must still defend the case

Case is ongoing — Honduras lost preliminary objections in February 2025

## What Locals Say

Nearby village of Crawfish Rock was never properly consulted

Told it was a "tourism project" — didn't learn it was a ZEDE until 2020

Community leader Luisa Connor: "They deceived us big time"

Connor: "The city will grow like a tumor. We will be the first to lose what we have."

Próspera threatened to cut off the village's water supply unless leaders submitted a written request

Villagers report: floods for the first time, dried-up river, environmental damage, family divisions, constant stress

## The Punchline

Even Paul Romer — the Nobel laureate who *invented* the charter city concept — says Próspera is "living in this libertarian fantasy that's not going to turn out well."

## And Now...

This same place is hosting crypto debate championships and "Infinite Games" festivals for tech bros to play prediction markets and get experimental gene therapies while a fishing village next door worries about losing their land and water.

## Próspera's Defense

### On the Legal Framework & "Narco" Origins

Próspera's main argument is essentially: the law is the law. They point out that:

- The ZEDE legislation passed with roughly 80% of Congress supporting it
- The constitutional reforms were unanimously approved by the Supreme Court (after the reconstituted court)
- They signed binding legal agreements with the Honduran government in 2017, including a 50-year legal stability guarantee
- CAFTA-DR (the US-Central America trade agreement) protects their investment regardless of who was in power when the laws passed

CEO Erick Brimen's framing is that Próspera is a victim of Honduras's political instability, not a beneficiary of corruption. "Most recently, the biggest challenge came in September of last year when the Supreme Court of Honduras ruled the ZEDE law unconstitutional. I recognize that transformative ideas often face obstacles before gaining broader acceptance."

### On the $11 Billion Claim

Próspera frames this as defensive, not aggressive. They claim they "did everything reasonably possible to avoid filing the claims, but the Government of Honduras continues to refuse to cooperate with our sustained efforts to find a negotiated solution."

They argue the full amount only applies if Honduras completely expropriates their investment—it's more of a ceiling than a demand.

They say Honduras "could mitigate the substantial liability it faces under international law by providing clear assurances that Honduras has no intention of expropriating investments in Próspera."

### On Local Community Relations

Próspera vigorously disputes the narrative from critics. Their response to Guardian reporting was: "We work closely with the local people, are the primary employer, and have a great connection with them. Only two people in the neighborhood are against us; the media only focuses on them."

They've promoted stories like Virginia Mann from Crawfish Rock, who says Próspera "has not only provided employment but has also created a supportive and caring work culture where employees feel valued and heard."

On displacement claims, they challenged critics directly on Twitter: "Can Jeff name 1 resident we have displaced? Of course not; the statement is false & misleading." Their charter explicitly disallows land expropriation—land can only join Próspera if owners voluntarily opt in.

### On the Mission

Brimen, a Venezuelan who grew up seeing "the poverty caused by socialism and lack of rule of law," frames the project as poverty relief through better governance. "Honduras Próspera is a comprehensive solution to a systemic problem, that addresses the issues at the root and lifts people out of poverty and into prosperity in a sustainable way."

The pitch: combine Honduras's people and location with best-practice governance from around the world. The "reciprocity stacking" model allows combining regulations from multiple OECD countries—so you can get a UK-approved drug, with a US-licensed doctor, using an Israeli medical device, following a Canadian procedure, all in one place.

"We've raised around $200 million and have invested heavily in the local infrastructure. In 2022 we represented almost a third of all greenfield FDI into Honduras."

### On Sovereignty

"We're not here at the expense of a nation-state," Brimen has insisted. "We think it is more of a partnership." He notes that 88% of Próspera's tax revenue stays with Próspera, with the remainder going to a trust for broader Honduran development.

## The Obvious Tensions

Even taking Próspera's framing charitably, there are some things they can't dispute:

**The judicial coup happened.** The judges who blocked charter cities were fired. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights subsequently condemned Honduras for this.

**Hernández is convicted.** The man who championed ZEDEs from Congress president through two presidential terms was running cocaine operations the entire time. Próspera can claim the law was valid, but they can't make the taint disappear.

**Local opposition is real.** Even if it's not universal, there's documented community resistance, and the nationwide movement against ZEDEs was significant enough to make it a signature campaign issue for Castro.

**The power asymmetry is grotesque.** A $10.8 billion claim against a country where half the population lives in poverty, representing two-thirds of the annual budget, is aggressive regardless of legal merit.

## Critical Analysis: Where Does Culpability Lie?

### Where Próspera has a reasonable defense

- They didn't fire the judges
- They didn't traffic cocaine
- They operated within what was formally legal at the time
- Lots of businesses invest in countries with corrupt governments without being held responsible for that corruption
- The ZEDE law was passed by supermajorities, not a backroom deal
- If your standard is "did Próspera do something illegal or directly participate in corruption," the answer appears to be no.

### Where it gets more complicated

**Selection effects.** Brimen explicitly tried to do this in US states first and got rejected. He went shopping for a jurisdiction desperate or corrupt enough to grant terms no functional democracy would accept. That's not illegal, but it reveals something about the model—it requires finding governments willing to alienate sovereignty in ways their populations wouldn't choose.

**The benefit was specific.** The 2012 Supreme Court ruling that got the judges fired was specifically about charter cities being unconstitutional. This wasn't incidental corruption that Próspera happened to exist alongside—the judicial purge was about enabling their project category. They're not like a random manufacturer who happened to set up shop during Hernández's tenure.

**Knowledge and timing.** Hernández's drug ties weren't secret—US prosecutors had been building cases, witnesses had flipped, his brother was arrested in 2018. Próspera continued expanding and raising money through all of this. At what point does "we're just following the law" become willful blindness to the fact that the law was created by a criminal enterprise?

**The Castro government is different.** The framing "the Honduran government is mostly responsible" conflates two opposing governments. Hernández created the framework. Castro ran explicitly against it, won, and her Congress voted unanimously to repeal it. The current democratic government is trying to exit an arrangement the previous narco-government locked them into.

**The lawsuit is a choice.** Even granting that Próspera's initial investment was made in good faith—the decision to sue for $11 billion (two-thirds of the national budget) when:
- The enabling framework was created by a convicted drug trafficker
- The democratically elected government wants out
- The country is desperately poor

...is not legally required. CAFTA-DR gives them standing, but they could negotiate, accept compensation for actual invested capital, or write it off. They're choosing maximum aggression.

### The structural issue

There's something almost Burnhamian here about the separation of formal and real power. Próspera can say "we followed all the rules" while the revealed preference of their model is: find countries where governance is weak or captured, lock in 50-year commitments that survive democratic transitions, then use international arbitration to make exit prohibitively expensive.

The legal framework lets them claim clean hands. But the design of that framework—negotiating legal stability agreements that bind future governments, choosing ICSID arbitration over local courts, the 50-year guarantee—all of this is specifically architected to make their project survive exactly the situation they're now in: a democratic government wanting to reverse what a corrupt predecessor did.

So: is Próspera more culpable than Hernández? No. But "less guilty than the cocaine kingpin" is a low bar. The better question might be: is this a model that depends on finding Hernándezes, and if so, what does that tell us about the project?

## A Vaserite Reading

### The obvious first move

Everyone in this story is lying about what they want, and the discourse is structured to prevent noticing the actual game.

### On the "narco" framing

The progressive critique wants you to see: corrupt drug president → ZEDE law → Próspera. Evil flows downstream.

But zoom out: Hernández was a US ally. He received military aid, DEA cooperation, State Department praise. The Obama and Trump administrations both worked with him while the drug evidence was accumulating. The same US government that eventually prosecuted him spent years enabling him.

So when Próspera says "we operated within the legal framework," they're not wrong—but that framework was jointly produced by the Honduran narco-state AND the US national security apparatus. The legitimacy question doesn't stop at the Honduran border.

### On what Próspera actually is

The libertarian story: we're bringing good governance to a country that lacks it, Hong Kong on the Caribbean, innovation zones, regulatory arbitrage for human flourishing.

The progressive story: neocolonial extraction, sovereignty violation, billionaire playground.

Both frames are copes that prevent seeing the actual object.

**What's really happening:** a group of people with a lot of capital wanted to buy the right to run a territory with minimal democratic accountability. They found a seller. The seller was a criminal enterprise, but that's why it was for sale—functional states don't sell sovereignty. The ideological packaging (freedom! innovation! charter cities!) is partially genuine belief, partially marketing, and partially a way for the participants to not notice what they're doing.

### The selection effect is the tell

Brimen tried US states first. Rejected. The model requires finding jurisdictions where:

- Governance is weak or captured
- Elites are willing to sell binding long-term commitments
- The population can't effectively resist
- International arbitration can override domestic politics

This isn't an accident or unfortunate necessity. It's the core product. Próspera isn't a charter city that happened to end up in a narco-state. The narco-state condition is what made the product possible.

### On the tech billionaire involvement

Thiel, Andreessen, Altman, Srinivasan. What do these people actually want when freed from political constraints?

The revealed preference here is: a place where they can do experimental gene therapies, avoid FDA oversight, implement prediction markets, run unregulated crypto operations, and build luxury compounds—all insulated from democratic accountability by international treaty.

The "poverty relief" framing is not exactly a lie—some locals do get jobs—but it's not what's being optimized for. What's being optimized for is exit: the ability to operate outside the jurisdiction of any government that might constrain you.

Balaji's "Network State" thesis is the explicit version: why capture existing states when you can build new ones? Próspera is the pilot project.

### The ISDS lawsuit reveals the real model

The $11 billion claim isn't an unfortunate necessity. It's the product working as designed.

The entire architecture—50-year legal stability agreements, CAFTA-DR arbitration clauses, Delaware incorporation—exists precisely to create this situation: a democratic government tries to exit an arrangement made by a corrupt predecessor, and the cost is set high enough to be prohibitive.

This is how capital disciplines states. Próspera is just being unusually visible about it. The same mechanism operates constantly through less dramatic investment treaties.

### The Romer angle

Paul Romer's original charter city concept involved guarantor nations—a developed democracy would oversee governance, providing legitimacy and accountability. Honduras tried this first (the REDs), and it failed because no respectable country wanted to be the guarantor.

The ZEDE model dropped the guarantor requirement. The result is a charter city without the thing that was supposed to make it legitimate. Romer looked at Próspera and said it's a "libertarian fantasy"—but that undersells it. It's not fantasy; it's the logical endpoint of removing the constraints he thought were essential.

### What's actually happening

A class of people with enough capital to buy small countries is experimenting with doing so. The ideological frame (liberty, innovation, escape from sclerotic regulation) is real enough to them, but the function is creating zones of exception where wealth can operate without democratic override.

Honduras is the test case because it was weak enough to sell. The question isn't whether Próspera is good or bad—it's whether this model scales, and what the world looks like if it does.

### The darkest read

The Trump pardon of Hernández, the Thiel/Andreessen Trump connections, the Próspera lawsuit—these aren't separate events. There's a faction that wants to normalize this model: private sovereignty zones, backed by US power, insulated from democratic accountability, protected by trade agreement arbitration.

Próspera isn't an anomaly. It's a proof of concept.

## On Ideology and Measurement

### The hard question about belief

How do you genuinely believe you're doing good while doing something that, from another angle, looks like buying sovereignty from a criminal enterprise?

The easy (and wrong) version is: "They know what they're doing and use ideology as cover." This is how critics often frame it, but it misses what's actually interesting. If Brimen were consciously thinking "I'm exploiting a weak country and using freedom rhetoric as a shield," he'd be a different kind of person—more cynical, probably less effective, and the project would have a different feel.

### How frameworks select what we see

When you adopt a framework, you're selecting:

- What counts as evidence
- What counts as success
- What questions to ask
- What comparisons to make

"Freedom" as a metric makes certain things visible (regulatory burden, tax rates, barriers to entry) and other things invisible or recategorized (power asymmetries, selection effects, who gets to make choices and who doesn't).

So Brimen looks at Próspera and genuinely sees:

- Businesses forming
- Regulations streamlined
- Jobs created
- Innovation enabled (gene therapy! prediction markets!)
- Voluntary transactions everywhere

All true! All real. Within the frame, it's working.

### What becomes invisible

What's harder to see from inside that frame:

**The selection mechanism.** Why did you have to come to Honduras? Not because Hondurans uniquely needed charter cities, but because stronger states said no. The fact that you're here reveals something about what you're doing, but the freedom frame doesn't capture it.

**Power asymmetries in "voluntary" transactions.** A villager in Crawfish Rock "choosing" to work at Próspera when it's the only significant employer isn't the same kind of choice as Brimen choosing to start the project. The frame treats these as equivalent.

**Path dependencies.** The ZEDE law was passed by a narco-Congress after a judicial coup. Those conditions enabled the project. But if you're measuring "did we follow the law?" you get a yes. The question "should that law have existed?" becomes invisible.

**Exit options.** For Próspera's investors, this is one project in a portfolio. For Roatán residents, it's their home. The asymmetry in exit options creates different stakes, but "voluntary participation" frame obscures this.

**Scale effects.** One startup city in Honduras might be a curiosity. If the model scales—if ZEDEs spread across weak states—you get a world where democratic governments increasingly can't govern their own territory. The frame sees local success; it doesn't see what happens if this becomes the dominant model.

### The ideological packaging function

The packaging (freedom! innovation! charter cities!) serves multiple purposes:

**It's partially genuine.** Brimen seems to really believe this. The Venezuelan refugee story, the poverty relief mission—this appears sincere.

**It's marketing.** You need this story to raise money, attract residents, defend against critics.

**It's a measurement system.** By deciding what counts as success, it determines what you optimize for and what you ignore.

**It's a psychological buffer.** It lets you not notice certain aspects of what you're doing. Not through conscious deception, but because the frame literally makes those aspects invisible or recategorizes them as non-problems.

### The measurement shapes the thing

"How we measure affects what is managed" is exactly right. But it goes deeper: how we measure affects what we see as real.

If your metrics are:
- Number of businesses registered
- Tax revenue generated
- Regulatory compliance rates
- Employment numbers
- Infrastructure investment

Then by those metrics, Próspera is succeeding. The problem isn't that these metrics are fake—they're real. The problem is they're partial. They capture one aspect of what's happening while systematically excluding others.

### The genuine belief problem

Here's what makes this tricky: I think Próspera supporters genuinely believe their mission is pure, even knowing all the additional details about Hernández, the judicial coup, the lawsuit dynamics.

How?

Because the framework filters the information. The Hernández stuff gets processed as: "unfortunate political context, but the law was still valid, and we're bringing good governance to replace bad governance."

The lawsuit gets processed as: "defensive action to protect our legitimate investment from political expropriation."

The local opposition gets processed as: "small minority amplified by media, while most locals benefit."

None of these are necessarily conscious lies. They're what you genuinely see when you look through that particular frame.

### The deeper pattern

What makes ideology powerful isn't that it tricks people into supporting things they'd otherwise oppose. It's that it makes certain ways of seeing feel natural and other ways of seeing not even occur to you.

Brimen looks at Próspera and sees innovation. The frame is doing its job—not by deceiving him, but by organizing his perception so that "innovation" is what appears.

Someone else looks at the exact same object and sees neocolonial extraction. That frame is also doing its job.

The question isn't which frame is true—it's what each frame makes visible and invisible, and whose interests that serves.

### The measurement insight applied

When you said "how we measure affects what is managed"—yes, but also:

How we measure affects what we *can* see as manageable.

If your only metrics are economic (business formation, tax revenue, employment), then non-economic harms (community cohesion, political sovereignty, exit option asymmetries) become invisible not just in reporting but in your actual perception.

You're not choosing to ignore them. Within the measurement frame, they're not there.

This is why genuine believers can coexist with structural harm. The ideology isn't a mask over the harm. It's a perceptual filter that makes the harm literally invisible to the person inside it.

And critically: the people inside the frame can know all the "additional details" (Hernández's conviction, the judicial coup, the lawsuit amounts) and still believe their mission is pure—because those details get processed through the frame into terms that preserve the moral narrative.

The frame isn't broken by contradictory information. It's antifragile to it. Each new piece of concerning information gets metabolized: "Yes, that's bad, but it doesn't change the core mission, which is bringing prosperity through better governance."

That's the real power of ideological packaging. Not that it tricks people, but that it reorganizes reality in a way that survives contact with facts that would seem, from the outside, to be devastating to the narrative.
