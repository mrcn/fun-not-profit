*"The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control."* — Epictetus

*"The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking if you like variations."* — Nassim Nicholas Taleb

*"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."* — Buckminster Fuller (inspiration for Gupta)
